/**
 This class is to solve the problem where individual actors may all trigger the same
 action, where only one instance of that action need be invoked. It's use in of itself
 is not a particularly good design pattern, but we sometimes find ourselves interacting
 with code whose behavior we can't control.
 
 The common problem is that N calls results in N actions where N-1 of those actions are redundant.
 In the case where the action is resource intensive, this is undesirable.  This could be the result of
 multiple objects making the call independently, or a response to a series of actions in a loop.
 
 By invoking via this object, the action will be performed after a short delay, but will
 only perform once. N-1 calls are effectively ignored. Once the timer is fired,
 or the async block is run, the next call will perform the action once again.
 
 The reason I use this code here is to allow multiple sections within a tableView or collectionView
 each have their own data source that work independently.  As a result, there can be cases where
 multiple sections will update their data on the same run-loop (usually due to responding to the
 same event) and if we only trigger animations for a single section, the app will crash as data
 in the other sections will be out of sync.
